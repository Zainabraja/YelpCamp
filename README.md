# YelpCamp
This project is from a course called Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele.
YelpCamp is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account.  This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

## Features
